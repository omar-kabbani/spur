User Guide
===========

Welcome! You are reading the user guide for Spur version |release|. In this guide, we'll walk through the thought and design process behind the software, and introduce you to the modelling process through a series of examples that cover a variety of possible uses cases.

We've written this user guide to be as friendly as possible, because one of the core tenets of Spur is to make railway modelling more open and accessible to more people. Wherever possible, we've avoided using language that is needlessly technical, and we've tried to keep the language friendly an inviting as opposed to formal and trite.
