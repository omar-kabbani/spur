Installation
============

Spur requires the following packages to run:

* [Simpy](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/)
* [PyQt6](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt6/)
* [Scipy](https://scipy.org/)

Conda Installation
------------------

You can install most of these modules with conda:

    conda install -c conda-forge simpy networkx scipy

However at the time of this writing `PyQt6` is only available via pip:
    pip install pyqt6


With these packages you should be able to run the base code.
