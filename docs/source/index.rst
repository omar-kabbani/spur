Spur: Simulate Preliminary and Unfussy Railways
===============================================

Spur is an event-based mesoscopic railway network simulation platform, designed
to support real-time operations and medium-term planning by capturing the 
stochastic movement of individual trains and the interactions between trains on 
the network. The model balances simplification with flexibility, and requires 
substantially less data and expertise than traditional microscopic simulation 
models.

This documentation website is designed both as a user manual and as a technical
documentation source for developers wishing to adapt or extend the software or
build their own plugins.

**If you are getting started with Spur** and would just like to build a simulation
and try it out, check out the :ref:`getting started<Getting Started>` page.

**If you are a developer** are are looking for the application programming
interface documentation, check out the API reference
