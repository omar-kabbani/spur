# Spur: Simulate Preliminary and Unfussy Railways

Spur is an event-based mesoscopic railway network simulation platform, designed
to support real-time operations and medium-term planning by capturing the 
stochastic movement of individual trains and the interactions between trains on 
the network. The model balances simplification with flexibility, and requires 
substantially less data and expertise than traditional microscopic simulation 
models.

## Getting Started
The model is currently under development, and as such there is no current
"getting started" process. This will be updated as functional releases are made.

If you are helping develop the software, it is recommended to set up a developer
environment for spur using conda in some capacity.
